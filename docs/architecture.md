# PiStellar Nexus Core Architecture

The PiStellar Nexus Core architecture is designed to provide a scalable and secure platform for interoperability between the Stellar and Pi networks. The architecture consists of the following components:

* **Stellar Protocol**: The Stellar protocol is responsible for interacting with the Stellar network.
* **Pi Network**: The Pi network is responsible for interacting with the Pi network.
* **Crypto Utilities**: The crypto utilities provide cryptographic functions for encrypting and decrypting data.
* **Network Utilities**: The network utilities provide functions for sending and receiving data over the network.
* **API Gateway**: The API gateway provides a unified interface for interacting with the PiStellar Nexus Core.

The architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy maintenance and extension of the platform.
